## Editing Email Templates

The Servv AI WordPress Plugin provides a user-friendly interface for customizing email templates to communicate effectively with event members:

### Enter Editing Mode
After selecting a template, use the built-in **Rich Text Editor** for standard formatting (e.g., bold, italics, lists).
For advanced customization, switch to the **HTML Editor** to directly edit the HTML code for tailored notifications.

<img src="/images/notification3.1.png" alt="Servv" width="700" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" /> <img src="/images/notification3.2.png" alt="Servv" width="700" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />

**Note**: Ensure that any custom HTML is compatible with common email clients (e.g., Gmail, Outlook) to avoid rendering issues for event members.

### Preview the Email
Use the **Preview** at the bottom of the template editor to view how the email will appear to event members.
Verify that dynamic variables (e.g., `{{event_name}}`) are correctly populated and that formatting is consistent across email clients.

<img src="/images/notification4.png" alt="Servv" width="700" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />

After editing, click the **Save** button to store your changes.
The plugin syncs the updated template with the servv.io platform, ensuring consistent notifications are sent to event members.
